# Goals

**SMART Goals Research:** Look up what a SMART goal is. Provide me with three sources that you looked up.

**Resume Improvements:** Look at 3-4 other classmatesâ€™ posts and identify 2-4 items that you think are novel approaches to improving your resume or LinkedIn Profile.

**Job Posting & Evaluation:** Find 3-4 jobs that you would like have applied or recommend. Provide links. And why are they good matches. Evaluate them.

**Equivalent:** what elements of the jobs are equivalent to what you already know? Equivalents could be languages, skills, CASE (computer-aided software environments, i.e., IDEs), tools, or techniques

**Improvements:** What elements do you think you could find out and learn about? (example could be domain knowledge, software, Third-party packages)

**SMART Goals:** From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of Improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at. (For example: What are some standard search engines? What makes a good match? What equivalent comparisons of languages, tools, and techniques? What are we missing?)

Create two S.M.A.R.T. goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time), one based on what you learned from your fellow classmates, and one from job search.
